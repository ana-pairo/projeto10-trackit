# Trackit - Front End Web App

![Trackit App Screenshots](screenshots.png)

Trackit is a simple front-end web application that helps users track their habits. It has three screens: Habits, Today, and History.

## Habits Screen

In the Habits screen, users can add a list of habits they want to follow. Users can also select the days of the week they want to do the habit. The app also allows users to edit or delete habits they have already added.

## Today Screen

In the Today screen, users can view the habits they have scheduled for the current day. Users can check off habits as they complete them.

## History Screen

The History screen is still in development. In this screen, users will be able to view their habit completion history.
